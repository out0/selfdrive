 We provide the following files in each dataset:
1. elevation map in PFM image format  with float values

2. cost map in PFM image format  with float values
unknown values assigned NaN; Obstacles assigned infinity; Traversable area has finite cost values in the range of (0, 0.75]

3. cost map in PNG image format with integer values
obstacles have cost 255; unknown space has cost 0; traversable area has finite cost values in the range (0, 255)

4. cost map for Bench-MR in PNG image format with integer values
obstacles have cost 0; unknown space has cost 0; traversable area has finite cost values in the range (0, 255) but inverted cost to meet the internal specifications of Bench-MR environment

We recommend to use the PFM images for completeness of cost values, whenever possible!
